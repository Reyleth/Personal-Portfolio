            <li>
                <strong>1833</strong>
                "Ada meets Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor, at a party, sparking a lifelong collaboration."

                "Ada translates an article on Babbage's Analytical Engine written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea from French to English, adding extensive notes and annotations that include what is now considered the first algorithm designed to be processed by a machine."

            <li>
                <strong>1843</strong>
                "Ada's translation and annotations, known as "Notes" or "Sketch of the Analytical Engine," are published in an English journal, introducing her insights on programming and algorithms."

            <li>
                <strong>1843</strong>
                "Ada describes how the Analytical Engine could be programmed to compute Bernoulli numbers, demonstrating the potential of computers to handle symbolic as well as numerical tasks."

            <li>
                <strong>1852</strong>

            <li>
                <strong>Late 20th century</strong>
                "Ada's work gains increasing recognition, with many scholars and historians celebrating her as a pioneer of computer science and programming."
