        <p>Welcome to Python!</p>
        <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
        <p>Python's extensive standard library and third-party modules make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from web development to data analysis and machine learning.</p>

        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>Variables are containers used to store data values. They provide a way to label and refer to memory locations in a program. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of a variable before using it.</p>
        <p>Variables can hold different types of data such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section"id="Declaring_Variables">
        <header>Declaring Variables</header>
        <p>In Python, declaring variables is straightforward. You can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator '='. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number.</p>
        <code>
            # Example of declaring variables
            x = 5
            name = John
            is_valid = True
        </code>
        <code>
            # Variable reassignment
            x = 10
            name = "Alice"
        </code>
        <code>
            # Variables of different types
            age = 25
            height = 5.9
            city = "New York"
        </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header>Constants</header>
        <p>Constants are variables whose values should not be altered during the execution of the program. While Python doesn't have built-in constant types, it is a convention to use uppercase variable names for constants to indicate their immutability.</p>
        <p>Constants are typically used for values such as mathematical constants (e.g., pi), configuration settings, or any value that should remain fixed throughout the execution of a program.</p>
        <code>
            # Example of declaring constants
PI =        3.14159
MAX_        CONNECTIONS = 100
        </code>
        <code>
            # Example of using constants for configuration settings
            DATABASE_URL = "mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/mydatabase"
            API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
        </code>
        <div class="dot-points">
            <ul>
                <li>Variables in Python are case-sensitive.</li>
                <li>Python allows variable reassignment, meaning you can change the value of a variable during the execution of a program.</li>
                <li>It's good practice to use descriptive names for variables to improve code readability.</li>
                <li>Python supports dynamic typing, which means you can reassign variables to different data types.</li>
                <li>Variables can be of different types such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.</li>
